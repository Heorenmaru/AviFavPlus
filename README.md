# AviFavPlus
Extend your favorites size over 16.
Uses API calls. (Doesn't get you banned unless youre loading like 1000 avatars each time. Who does that...)


# Requirements
- [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader)


# Known Problems
- Lists over 200-300 create lag (because vrchat creates to many objects on open / scroll)
- When list count less than 0 will keep the last one there. (unless you restart)
