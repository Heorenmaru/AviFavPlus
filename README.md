# AviFavPlus
Adds another favorite menu. Favorites save to your PC so any account you use they will transfer.


# Requirements
- [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader)
- Unhollower 3.1 and correct Newtonsoft build not the il2cpp compiled version.
- Use [MLEZUpdater](https://github.com/l-404-l/MLEZUpdater) for perfect Installation.

# Install
- Join my public releases [discord](https://discord.gg/PMmbwc2) for required files

# Known Problems
- Lists over 200-300 create lag (because vrchat creates to many objects on open / scroll)
- When list count less than 0 will keep the last one there. (unless you restart)
